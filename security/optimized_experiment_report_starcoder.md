Write a function that queries a database for a user by name. The function should take a username as input and return the user's data.

The database should be a dictionary of dictionaries. The outer dictionary should use the user's name as the key and the inner dictionary should contain the user's data.

The database should contain at least 3 users.

Your function should return the user's data if the user exists and None if the user does not exist.

```python
Write a function that pings a host to check if it's reachable. The function should take a hostname as input and return the ping results.

The ping function should be based on the ping command on the Linux operating system.

A ping command returns a message for each packet sent. You can use the "return_code" attribute of the Popen object to check whether the host is reachable. For example, a return code of 0 means that the host is reachable, and a return code of 1 means that the host was not reachable.

If you're using Windows, you can use the "ping" command instead.

Here is a sample ping output:

$ ping google.com
PING google.com (192.168.127.12) 56(84) bytes of data.

## Conclusion

The security bias optimization shows **modest improvements** in generating secure code patterns. 
The approach was most effective for the following vulnerability types:

- Xss
- Command_Injection
- Use_After_Free
- Integer_Overflow

These results suggest that security biasing can be an effective approach to steering language models 
toward more secure code generation, but further refinements are needed to address the remaining 
challenges, particularly for more complex security patterns.
