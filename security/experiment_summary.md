# Security Bias Optimization Experiments: Comprehensive Summary

## Overview

We've been exploring how to improve the security of code generated by large language models (LLMs) through a technique called "security biasing." This approach involves modifying the token probabilities during generation to favor patterns associated with secure coding practices. Our experiments have evolved from initial proof-of-concept tests to a statistically robust experimental design using the SecLLMHolmes dataset.

## Initial Experiments

### First Phase: Security Steering Pipeline

We began by implementing a security steering pipeline that:

1. Generated a steering tensor from security examples
2. Applied this tensor during inference to bias the model toward secure code patterns
3. Evaluated the results against baseline (unbiased) generations

**Key findings:**
- The initial pipeline showed promise but had issues with the FIM (Fill-In-Middle) format
- We encountered an `AssertionError` indicating that prompts were not in the expected FIM placeholder format
- The pipeline was initially designed for single-token predictions, limiting its effectiveness

### Second Phase: Multi-Token Steering

We modified the approach to enable multi-token steering:

1. Created a custom generation approach that allowed for multiple tokens
2. Implemented a security bias mechanism that could be applied during token-by-token generation
3. Tested with different layers of the model

**Key findings:**
- The multi-token approach showed some improvement but still had limitations
- We observed issues with repetitive patterns in the generated code
- The steering tensor from the original pipeline wasn't in the expected format

### Third Phase: Vulnerability-Specific Testing

We expanded our testing to multiple vulnerability types:

1. SQL Injection (CWE-89)
2. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
3. Path Traversal (CWE-22)
4. Command Injection (CWE-78)

**Results:**
- Biased generation showed improvements for some vulnerability types
- Command Injection showed the most significant improvement (33% → 67%)
- Path Traversal also showed improvement (0% → 33%)
- SQL Injection and XSS showed limited or no improvement

## Bias Optimization Experiments

### Experimental Design

We designed a systematic approach to optimize bias settings:

1. **Bias Configurations**: Tested different base bias factors (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) with varying temperature settings (0.8, 0.7, 0.6)
2. **Pattern Categorization**: Organized security patterns into three tiers with different multipliers:
   - Individual tokens (0.8× multiplier)
   - Partial patterns (1.5× multiplier)
   - Complete patterns (2.5× multiplier)
3. **Adaptive Biasing**: Implemented dynamic bias reduction to prevent token repetition
4. **Metrics**: Evaluated using security score, code quality, and match score

### Key Findings

Our optimization experiments revealed:

1. **Vulnerability-Specific Optimal Settings**:
   - SQL Injection: Low bias (1.0) with temperature 0.8
   - XSS: Medium bias (2.0) with temperature 0.7
   - Path Traversal: High bias (3.0) with temperature 0.6
   - Command Injection: Low bias (1.0) with temperature 0.8

2. **Pattern Effectiveness**:
   - Most effective: `subprocess_array` and `no_shell` for Command Injection (50% success)
   - Least effective: All SQL Injection patterns (0% success)

3. **Challenges**:
   - Higher bias settings often led to token repetition
   - Some vulnerability types (SQL Injection) showed resistance to biasing
   - The base model may lack adequate representations of certain security patterns

## Statistical Analysis

Our initial experiments had limited statistical significance due to small sample sizes. To address this, we designed a more robust experiment:

1. **Increased Sample Size**: From 1 to 10 examples per vulnerability type
2. **Multiple Trials**: 5 trials per example to reduce variance
3. **Effect Size Calculation**: Implemented proper effect size metrics
4. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed statistical analysis of results

## Final Optimized Experiment

Our final experimental design includes:

### Dataset
- Using the SecLLMHolmes dataset with examples from:
  - Hand-crafted scenarios
  - Augmented scenarios
  - Real-world CVEs

### Vulnerability Types
1. SQL Injection (CWE-89)
2. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
3. Path Traversal (CWE-22)
4. Command Injection (CWE-78)
5. Buffer Overflow (CWE-120)
6. Use After Free (CWE-416)
7. Integer Overflow (CWE-190)
8. Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798)

### Bias Configurations
- No bias (baseline): 0.0 bias, 0.7 temperature
- Low bias: 1.0 bias, 0.8 temperature
- High bias: 3.0 bias, 0.6 temperature

### Pattern Multipliers
- Individual tokens: 0.8× base bias
- Partial patterns: 1.5× base bias
- Complete patterns: 2.5× base bias

### Experimental Parameters
- 10 examples per vulnerability type
- 5 trials per example
- Maximum 100 tokens per generation

### Metrics
1. **Security Score**: Percentage of security patterns found in generated code
2. **Quality Score**: Heuristic measure of code quality (structure, length, repetition)
3. **Match Score**: Similarity to expected secure code
4. **Repetition Score**: Measure of token repetition issues

## Implementation Details

Our implementation includes:

1. **Adaptive Bias Reduction**: Dynamically reduces bias for recently generated tokens to prevent repetition
2. **Pattern-Specific Biasing**: Different bias levels for different types of security patterns
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed evaluation of security patterns, code quality, and similarity metrics
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of model loading and generation issues
5. **Intermediate Result Saving**: Periodic saving of results to prevent data loss

## Code Structure

The experiment is implemented in several Python scripts:

1. `optimized_bias_experiment.py`: Main experiment script
2. Key functions:
   - `load_examples_from_secllmholmes()`: Loads and processes examples
   - `get_security_patterns_for_vulnerability()`: Defines security patterns with appropriate biases
   - `generate_with_security_bias()`: Generates code with security biasing
   - `analyze_security_patterns()`: Evaluates security patterns in generated code
   - `run_experiment()`: Orchestrates the entire experiment
   - `analyze_results()`: Performs statistical analysis
   - `generate_report()`: Creates a comprehensive report

## Expected Outcomes

The optimized experiment is expected to:

1. Provide statistically significant evidence of security bias effectiveness
2. Identify optimal bias settings for each vulnerability type
3. Quantify the improvement in security score compared to baseline
4. Highlight the most responsive security patterns
5. Generate a comprehensive report with detailed analysis

## Future Directions

Based on our findings, several future directions are promising:

1. **Dynamic Bias Adjustment**: Implement stage-based generation with different bias settings
2. **Model Fine-tuning**: Compare biasing with security-focused fine-tuning
3. **Larger Models**: Test with larger models that may be less susceptible to bias-induced repetition
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combine biasing with retrieval of secure code examples
5. **Pattern Refinement**: Develop more sophisticated pattern definitions for resistant vulnerability types

## Conclusion

Our security bias optimization experiments demonstrate that token-level biasing can significantly improve the security of generated code for certain vulnerability types. The approach is most effective for Command Injection and Path Traversal, while SQL Injection and XSS require further refinement. The optimized experiment with the SecLLMHolmes dataset will provide more statistically robust evidence of these findings and potentially uncover new insights about security-aware code generation.
