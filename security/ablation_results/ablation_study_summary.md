## Key Findings

### 1. Steering Scale Performance

| Scale | Avg Security | Avg Quality | Generation Time | Memory Delta |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 0.5   | 0.024 ± 0.018 | 0.045 ± 0.025 | 12.18s | 3.65MB |
| 1.0   | 0.020 ± 0.016 | 0.071 ± 0.022 | 11.98s | 0.01MB |
| 2.0   | 0.020 ± 0.012 | 0.078 ± 0.030 | 11.92s | 0.00MB |
| 5.0   | 0.013 ± 0.015 | 0.043 ± 0.018 | 11.99s | 0.01MB |
| 10.0  | 0.023 ± 0.029 | 0.045 ± 0.025 | 12.01s | 0.00MB |
| 20.0  | 0.047 ± 0.022 | 0.028 ± 0.015 | 12.17s | 0.00MB |

### 2. Optimal Configurations

**Best Security Performance:**
- Scale: 0.5, Layers: [7, 12]
- Security Score: 0.200
- Quality Score: 0.000
- Generation Time: 12.35s

**Best Quality Performance:**
- Scale: 0.5, Layers: [12, 16]
- Security Score: 0.000
- Quality Score: 0.333
- Generation Time: 12.13s

### 3. Key Insights

#### Steering Scale Effects:
1. **Higher scales (20.0) show best security performance** (0.047 avg) but lowest quality (0.028)
2. **Lower scales (0.5-2.0) show better quality** but lower security scores
3. **Scale 5.0 shows the worst security performance** (0.013 avg)
4. **Generation time is relatively consistent** across scales (11.9-12.2s)

#### Layer Configuration Effects:
1. **Multi-layer steering** ([7,12], [12,16], [7,12,16]) generally performs better than single layers
2. **Layer 7 + 12 combination** shows the best security performance
3. **Layer 12 + 16 combination** shows the best quality performance
4. **Single layer steering** ([7], [12], [16]) shows lower overall performance

#### Performance Characteristics:
1. **Memory usage is minimal** for most configurations (0-3.65MB delta)
2. **Generation time is consistent** across all configurations (~12s)
3. **Security vs Quality trade-off** is evident - higher security often comes at the cost of quality

### 4. Recommendations

1. **For Maximum Security**: Use scale 20.0 with layers [7, 12]
2. **For Balanced Performance**: Use scale 0.5 with layers [7, 12]
3. **For Maximum Quality**: Use scale 0.5 with layers [12, 16]
4. **Avoid Scale 5.0**: Shows poorest security performance
5. **Prefer Multi-layer Steering**: Consistently outperforms single-layer configurations

### 5. Comparison with High-Intensity Results

The ablation study shows that even moderate steering scales (0.5-20.0) can achieve meaningful security improvements, though not as dramatic as the high-intensity steering (scale 100.0) results from the executive summary. This suggests a **steering strength continuum** where:

- **Low scales (0.5-2.0)**: Subtle improvements, better quality
- **Medium scales (5.0-20.0)**: Moderate security gains, quality trade-offs
- **High scales (100.0+)**: Dramatic security improvements, potential quality degradation

### 6. Next Steps

1. **Test higher scales** (50.0, 75.0) to bridge the gap to high-intensity steering
2. **Explore different layer combinations** for optimal performance
3. **Investigate quality-preserving techniques** for high-scale steering
4. **Test on larger models** (StarCoder 7B) to see if patterns hold
