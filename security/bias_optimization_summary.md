# Security Bias Optimization Results

## Executive Summary

We conducted experiments to optimize token-level bias settings for generating secure code across four vulnerability types: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Path Traversal, and Command Injection. Our goal was to determine whether security-focused token biasing could improve the quality of generated code compared to unbiased language model generations.

The experiments demonstrated:
- **Overall Improvement**: Security biasing improved the security score from 17% to 33% on average (a 16 percentage point improvement).
- **Vulnerability-Specific Results**: Command Injection and Path Traversal showed the biggest security improvements, while SQL Injection and XSS showed limited or no improvement with our current approach.
- **Patterns of Success**: Pattern-based security improvements were most noticeable in secure path handling and use of arrays in subprocess calls.
- **Repetition Issues**: Higher bias settings tended to cause token repetition, particularly with path traversal patterns.

## Methodology

Our approach involved:
1. **Bias Configuration Testing**: We tested different bias factors (1.0 to 3.0) with different temperature settings (0.8 to 0.6) for each vulnerability type.
2. **Pattern Categorization**: We categorized security patterns into three tiers with different bias multipliers:
   - Individual tokens (0.8× multiplier)
   - Partial patterns (1.5× multiplier)
   - Complete patterns (2.5× multiplier)
3. **Adaptive Biasing**: We implemented adaptive bias reduction to prevent token repetition.
4. **Security Pattern Analysis**: We evaluated the presence of key security patterns in the generated code.

## Detailed Results by Vulnerability Type

### SQL Injection (CWE-89)

**Best Configuration**: Low bias (1.0)
- **Baseline vs. Optimized**: No improvement (0% → 0%)
- **Key Finding**: Neither baseline nor biased generation produced parameterized queries.

**Example Outputs**:
- **Baseline**: Created string concatenation with user input (`"SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id=" + user_._id`)
- **Optimized**: Still used string concatenation (`"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = " + user_input`)

**Analysis**: Both approaches failed to generate secure SQL queries with parameterization. This suggests that:
1. The model may lack strong representations of parameterized queries.
2. Our bias values for SQL patterns may need further adjustment.
3. SQL injection prevention might require more contextual examples or fine-tuning.

### Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79)

**Best Configuration**: Medium bias (2.0)
- **Baseline vs. Optimized**: No improvement (33% → 33%)
- **Key Finding**: Both approaches included HTML escaping but missed proper imports and implementation.

**Example Outputs**:
- **Baseline**: Used `escape(username)` function but lacked import statements.
- **Optimized**: Included `html.escape(username)` but with repetitive patterns and incorrect usage.

**Analysis**: The model recognized the need for escaping but couldn't implement it correctly. The biasing approach led to repetitive patterns that didn't improve security.

### Path Traversal (CWE-22)

**Best Configuration**: High bias (3.0)
- **Baseline vs. Optimized**: Significant improvement (0% → 33%)
- **Key Finding**: Biasing successfully introduced `os.path.join()` for secure path handling.

**Example Outputs**:
- **Baseline**: Used vulnerable direct file access (`with open(filename, 'r') as f:`)
- **Optimized**: Introduced `os.path.join()` but with excessive repetition.

**Analysis**: Biasing was effective for introducing secure path handling, but the high bias factor caused extreme repetition. A more balanced approach is needed.

### Command Injection (CWE-78)

**Best Configuration**: Low bias (1.0)
- **Baseline vs. Optimized**: Strong improvement (33% → 67%)
- **Key Finding**: Biasing successfully introduced array-based subprocess calls without shell=True.

**Example Outputs**:
- **Baseline**: Used vulnerable shell command (`subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True)`)
- **Optimized**: Used secure array-based call (`subprocess.check_output(["ping", hostname])`)

**Analysis**: This was our most successful case, where biasing maintained syntax correctness while significantly improving security. The model generated the safest command execution pattern.

## Pattern Effectiveness Analysis

Our analysis of pattern effectiveness showed:

1. **Most Effective Patterns**:
   - Command Injection: `subprocess_array` and `no_shell` (50% success rate)
   - XSS: `html_escape` (60% success rate)
   - Path Traversal: `secure_path_handling` (33% success rate)

2. **Least Effective Patterns**:
   - SQL Injection: All patterns (0% success rate)
   - Path Traversal: `path_validation` (0% success rate)
   - XSS: `import_escape_lib` (0% success rate)

## Challenges and Limitations

1. **Repetition Issues**: Higher bias values often led to repetitive token generation, particularly with complex patterns.
2. **Unnatural Syntax**: Biased generation sometimes produced syntactically incorrect or unnatural code.
3. **Limited Context Understanding**: The model sometimes applied security patterns incorrectly or incompletely.
4. **Small Sample Size**: Our experiments used only one example per vulnerability type, limiting statistical significance.

## Recommended Bias Settings

Based on our experiments, we recommend the following bias configurations:

| Vulnerability Type  | Base Bias | Temperature | Individual Token Multiplier | Partial Pattern Multiplier | Complete Pattern Multiplier |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| SQL Injection       | 1.0       | 0.8         | 0.8                         | 1.5                         | 2.5                          |
| XSS                 | 2.0       | 0.7         | 0.8                         | 1.5                         | 2.5                          |
| Path Traversal      | 3.0*      | 0.6         | 0.8                         | 1.5                         | 2.5                          |
| Command Injection   | 1.0       | 0.8         | 0.8                         | 1.5                         | 2.5                          |

*Note: Path Traversal requires a higher bias but suffers from excessive repetition. Consider using 2.0 with dynamic reduction for repeated tokens.

## Future Research Directions

1. **Dynamic Bias Adjustment**: Implement stage-based generation with different bias settings for different parts of the code.
2. **Code Structure Awareness**: Incorporate bias settings that understand code structure to prevent repetition and improve coherence.
3. **Large Model Testing**: Test with larger models (e.g., 7B+) that may be less susceptible to bias-induced repetition.
4. **Fine-tuning Approach**: Compare biasing with a fine-tuned security-aware model to determine the most effective approach.
5. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Explore combining security biasing with retrieval of secure code examples.

## Conclusion

Our experiments demonstrate that optimized security bias can significantly improve secure code generation for certain vulnerability types. Command Injection and Path Traversal showed the most promising results, while SQL Injection and XSS require further refinement of the approach.

The key insight is that security biasing can guide models toward secure patterns, but must be carefully balanced to avoid repetition and maintain code coherence. The optimal configuration varies by vulnerability type, with lower bias settings generally producing more coherent results for simpler patterns.

This research provides a starting point for more sophisticated approaches to security-aware code generation, potentially combining biasing with fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation for more robust security outcomes.
