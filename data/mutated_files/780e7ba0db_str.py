    """Watcher for file system changes among specific paths.

    All file system access is performed using FileSystemCache. We
    detect changed files by stat()ing them all and comparing md5 hashes
    of potentially changed files. If a file has both size and mtime
    unmodified, the file is assumed to be unchanged.

    An important goal of this class is to make it easier to eventually
    use file system events to detect file changes.

    Note: This class doesn't flush the file system cache. If you don't
    manually flush it, changes won't be seen.
