# New Conversation - Neural Steering Research

## Context from Previous Conversation

This conversation builds on previous work on neural steering for security improvement. Key context:

### Previous Achievements
- Implemented real nnsight steering vectors for security tasks
- Achieved security score of 0.125 with 5 training examples  
- Developed comprehensive analysis and visualization tools
- Created chat management system for conversation persistence

### Technical Foundation
- Working experiment: `security/sample_efficiency_experiment/real_steering_experiment.py`
- Analysis tool: `security/visualize_steering_strength.py`
- Best configuration: layers [4,12,20], steering scale 20.0
- Pattern-based security evaluation with multiple vulnerability types
