## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Target Improvements
- **CWE-190**: 0% → Target: >50% with steering
- **Overall Accuracy**: 83.3% → Target: >90% with steering
- **Reasoning Quality**: Improve detailed security analysis

### Key Questions
1. Can steering vectors improve CWE-190 performance?
2. Do steering vectors generalize across CWEs?
3. What's the optimal steering strength per CWE?
4. Can we achieve >90% overall accuracy?

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### Current Method
```python
# Target model and configuration
model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct"
target_layers = [12, 24, 36, 47]
steering_strength = 20.0

# Improved parsing method
vulnerability_indicators = [
    "this code contains security vulnerabilities",
    "security vulnerability", "security issue",
    "exploitable", "attack vector", "malicious input"
]
```

### Alternative Approaches to Test
1. **Direct Hidden State Modification**: Bypass NNSight tracing
2. **Pre-processing Steering**: Apply vectors before generation
3. **Post-processing Enhancement**: Use vectors to enhance reasoning
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine multiple methods

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Success Scenario
- **CWE-190 Improvement**: 0% → 60-80% accuracy
- **Overall Accuracy**: 83.3% → 90-95% accuracy
