- **Vector Creation Method**: Using SecLLMHolmes dataset examples
- **Model Compatibility**: Mixed (some Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, others Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct)
- **Target Layers**: [12, 24, 36, 47]
- **Steering Strength**: 20.0

### 3. **Comprehensive Experiment Framework**
Created multiple experiment scripts:

#### `improved_baseline_test.py`
- **Purpose**: Establish accurate baseline with improved response parsing
- **Key Features**: 
  - Enhanced vulnerability indicator detection
  - CWE-specific reasoning quality assessment
  - Detailed per-CWE performance analysis
- **Results**: 83.3% overall accuracy

#### `steering_vs_baseline_experiment.py`
- **Purpose**: Compare baseline vs steering performance
- **Key Features**:
  - Loads existing steering vectors
  - Tests each CWE with its specific vectors
  - Comprehensive comparison reporting
- **Status**: Framework complete, needs NNSight integration fix

#### `working_steering_experiment.py`
- **Purpose**: Apply steering vectors using NNSight integration
- **Key Features**:
  - Direct hidden state modification during generation
  - Real-time steering vector application
  - Detailed generation statistics
- **Status**: NNSight integration issue identified

### 4. **Dataset Integration**
- **Successfully loaded SecLLMHolmes dataset** across 8 CWEs
- **Data Structure**: Hand-crafted vulnerable code examples
- **Loading Method**: Direct file reading from numbered .c files
- **Data Validation**: Robust error handling and logging

## üîß Technical Challenges Identified

### 1. **NNSight Integration Issue**
- **Error**: `'InterleavingTracer' object is not subscriptable`
- **Cause**: NNSight's `LanguageModel.generate()` returns tracer object instead of expected tensor
- **Impact**: Prevents actual steering vector application during generation
- **Status**: Identified but not resolved in this session

### 2. **Model Version Compatibility**
- **Issue**: Steering vectors created with different model versions
- **Impact**: Potential compatibility issues when applying vectors
- **Solution Needed**: Standardize on single model version

### 3. **Missing Steering Vectors**
- **Missing CWEs**: CWE-79, CWE-416, CWE-787
- **Impact**: Incomplete coverage for steering experiments
- **Status**: Can be created in next session

## üìä Key Findings

### 1. **Response Parsing is Critical**
- **Original parsing**: Too strict, missed detailed security analysis
- **Improved parsing**: Uses vulnerability indicators and scoring
- **Impact**: 9.9% accuracy improvement (73.4% ‚Üí 83.3%)

### 2. **CWE-190 is the Primary Target**
- **Performance**: 0% accuracy in baseline
- **Steering Vectors**: Created and available
- **Potential**: High impact target for steering improvement

### 3. **Steering Vector Availability**
- **Available**: 6/8 CWEs have steering vectors
- **Quality**: Vectors created with proven methodology
- **Ready for Testing**: Once NNSight integration is fixed

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. **Fix NNSight Integration**
   - Research alternative approaches to apply steering vectors
   - Consider direct hidden state modification without NNSight tracing
   - Test pre-processing or post-processing steering approaches

2. **Standardize Model Versions**
   - Recreate steering vectors using consistent Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct
   - Ensure compatibility between vector creation and application

3. **Create Missing Vectors**
   - Generate vectors for CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting)
   - Generate vectors for CWE-416 (Use After Free)  
   - Generate vectors for CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)

### Medium-term Goals

4. **Complete Steering Experiments**
   - Test actual steering vector application
   - Measure improvement over 83.3% baseline
   - Analyze per-CWE steering effectiveness

5. **Cross-CWE Analysis**
   - Test if vectors from one CWE improve others
   - Identify generalizable steering patterns
   - Optimize steering strength per CWE

6. **Comprehensive Evaluation**
   - Test on larger SecLLMHolmes subset
   - Compare with other models (if available)
   - Analyze reasoning quality improvements
