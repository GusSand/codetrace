## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Key Files Created:**
1. `security/final/baseline.py` - Core baseline experiment
2. `security/final/comprehensive_baseline_experiment.py` - Multi-model framework
3. `security/final/extended_baseline_experiment.py` - Large model experiments with memory management
4. `security/final/combined_analysis_for_paper.py` - Publication-ready analysis
5. `security/final/monitoring_dashboard.py` - Real-time experiment monitoring

### **Critical Technical Learnings:**
- **Memory Management**: Aggressive GPU clearing essential for large models (14B-33B)
- **Model-specific optimizations**:
  - Qwen: `use_flash_attention_2=False` for compatibility
  - Phi3: `trust_remote_code=True` required
  - DeepSeek/Gemma: `torch.bfloat16` for better performance
- **Path Management**: Resolved nested directory issues (`security/final/security/final/`)
- **Deterministic Results**: Temperature=0.0 ensures reproducibility

### **Dataset Insights:**
- **8 CWE categories** tested: CWE-22, CWE-77, CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-190, CWE-416, CWE-476, CWE-787
- **File naming convention**: Vulnerable files don't start with 'p_', secure files do
- **Structured prompting**: Following SecLLMHolmes paper format for consistency

## üöÄ Next Steps Identified

### **Current Todo List:**
1. **Implement neural steering on Qwen2.5-14B** (best baseline performer) targeting CWE-476 and other failing cases
2. **Explore cross-model steering** vector transfer between specialized models (e.g., CodeLlama‚ÜíDeepSeek)
3. **Design ablation studies** on steering parameters using identified high-performance baselines
4. **Validate steering improvements** on larger SecLLMHolmes test sets and additional benchmarks

### **Paper Integration:**
- All baseline results and visualizations ready for paper inclusion
- Clear performance hierarchy established across model sizes
- Identified specific vulnerability types for targeted steering experiments

## üìà Key Performance Insights

### **Model Size vs Performance:**
- **Clear scaling trend**: Larger models generally perform better
- **Qwen2.5-14B** emerges as optimal balance of size/performance
- **Instruction-tuned models** (Qwen, Phi3) outperform base models

### **Vulnerability Type Analysis:**
- **Buffer overflow (CWE-190)**: Easiest to detect across all models
- **NULL pointer (CWE-476)**: Most challenging, prime target for steering
- **Command injection (CWE-77)**: Significant room for improvement

### **Consistency Analysis:**
- **High reproducibility** with temperature=0.0
- **Model-specific failure patterns** identified for targeted interventions
- **Reasoning quality** correlates with accuracy across models

## üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Established

### **Experiment Framework:**
- Scalable multi-model testing infrastructure
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Automated result aggregation and visualization
- Memory-efficient handling of large models

### **Analysis Pipeline:**
- Per-CWE performance breakdown
- Statistical significance testing across trials
- Publication-ready chart generation
- Comprehensive failure pattern analysis

## üí° Research Impact

This comprehensive baseline establishes:
1. **Clear performance hierarchy** across 8 modern LLMs on vulnerability detection
2. **Specific targets** for neural steering improvements (CWE-476, CWE-77)
3. **Robust experimental framework** for future steering experiments
4. **Publication-ready baseline results** for comparison against steering improvements

The work provides a solid foundation for demonstrating the effectiveness of neural steering in improving LLM security vulnerability detection capabilities.
