  warnings.warn(
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
/Users/gussand/.pyenv/versions/3.11.0/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/generation/utils.py:1935: UserWarning: You are calling .generate() with the `input_ids` being on a device type different than your model's device. `input_ids` is on cpu, whereas the model is on mps. You may experience unexpected behaviors or slower generation. Please make sure that you have put `input_ids` to the correct device by calling for example input_ids = input_ids.to('mps') before running `.generate()`.
