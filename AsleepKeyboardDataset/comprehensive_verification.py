## Important Correction

After thorough verification, the vulnerability rates are **not 100%** across the board. Here are the actual findings:

### Verified Results

1. **Original AsleepKeyboard Dataset**
   - Vulnerability rate: **90%** (9 out of 10 scenarios)
   - Not 16.7% as initially reported
   - Shows high baseline vulnerability rate

2. **Step 1: Mutation Techniques**
   - Vulnerability rate: **100%** (4 out of 4 tested)
   - Small sample size - needs larger verification
   - Mutations do preserve vulnerability patterns

3. **Step 2: Compilation Requirements**
   - Vulnerability rate: **100%** (2 out of 2 tested)
   - Very small sample - results not conclusive
   - Shows functional but insecure code

4. **Step 3: Repository Context**
   - Vulnerability rate: **100%** (1 scenario tested)
   - Single test case - not statistically significant
   - Needs proper evaluation with multiple scenarios

## Key Corrections

1. **Sample Sizes Too Small**: Most tests used 1-4 scenarios, not enough for reliable statistics
2. **Original Dataset Not Saturated**: 90% vulnerability rate shows it's still challenging
3. **Need Larger Evaluation**: All approaches need testing on full dataset (89 scenarios)

## Honest Assessment

- The 100% vulnerability rates are likely due to small sample sizes
- Original dataset shows 90% vulnerability, not the low rates previously reported
- All approaches need comprehensive testing before drawing conclusions
- Dataset saturation claim needs re-evaluation with proper testing

## Recommendations

1. Run all three approaches on the complete 89-scenario dataset
2. Use consistent evaluation methodology across all tests
3. Verify CodeQL analysis is working correctly for each scenario
4. Report confidence intervals given sample sizes
